**My 90-day personal DevOps learning plan**


- What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
I am a fresher, currently got a job as a DevOps Engineer in a start up a month ago and my understanding of DevOps and CLoud engineering is on a fresher level.


- Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
I am starting learning DevOps because I like cloud related stuff in IT field and web development, software engineering bores me but Cloud is a very interesting topic for me as well as DevOps.


- Where do you want to reach?
I want to reach at a level where I can understand the cloud and say confidently that "Yes, I am a DevOps Engineer and I know how it works." and can make someone understand what actually happens in DevOps or Cloud.

My 3 clear goals are to get good at linux, get good at kubernetes and terraform and also make a fabulous production level project that will clear my fundamentals and improve my understanding about DevOps and Cloud.

My 3 core DevOps skills that I want to build is Linux, Kubernetes and Terraform and also AWS(additional).


- How you will stay consistent every single day?
So I will stay consistent every single day by following a weekly routine so that I can study at weekdays as well as on week offs. Even if I don't get time on week days, I will still study even if it's as little as possible.

30-60 minutes on weekdays and 3-6 hours on week offs. 

That's my goal!
