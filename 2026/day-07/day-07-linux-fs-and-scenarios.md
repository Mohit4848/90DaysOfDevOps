4) /etc - It contains configuration files. As it contains system configuration files, I would like to use it when I have problem with the service configuration.

5) /var/log - It contains log files which is very important for us. I would use it when I want to identify why any crashes are happening to a service, service error and authentication problem.

6) /tmp - This contains temporary files. I would use it to delete temporary files if my system becomes slow and also for debugging application behaviour.
