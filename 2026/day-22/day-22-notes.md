1️) Difference Between git add and git commit

git add moves changes to staging area.

git commit saves staged changes permanently in repository history.

2️) What Does the Staging Area Do?

The staging area allows you to:

Select specific changes

Review before committing

Control what goes into a commit

Without staging, commits would be automatic and less controlled.

3️) What Does git log Show?

Commit hash

Author

Date

Commit message

4️) What is .git Folder?

Stores entire repository database

Contains objects, refs, config, HEAD

If deleted:

Git history is gone

Folder becomes normal directory

5️) Working Directory vs Staging vs Repository

Working Directory → Where you edit files
Staging Area → Where you prepare changes
Repository → Where commits are stored permanently
